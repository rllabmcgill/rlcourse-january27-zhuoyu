# The R code includes the following algorithms:

Iterative policy evaluation
 -Jacobi-style algorithm (two array version)
 -Gauss-Seidel-style algorithm (in place version)
 -Prioritized Sweeping
Policy iteration
Value iteration (modified policy iteration)

# Slides of Prioritized Sweeping
Since no one mentioned Prioritized Sweeping (Moore et al., 1993) in the lecture of this morning, I made a few slides to explain it. The original paper is not easy to follow. But I made it very easy to understand, with a more strateforward example. I hope some one will be interested in it.
